# Project Overview
The Chinese Calligraphy Website is a team project, this website project is intended to introduce the masterpiece of Chinese Calligraphy to the public as well as its history and tools. The website is equiped with a user login system which allows users to log in and save their faviourite masterpieces into their personal page. The Website is reponsive designed, we choose a more direct way to display the content in the mobile view, while we have more animation on the larger view.

# Main Challenge & Why using Flask 
The hardest thing for this project is the time limits, we only have two weeks to finish it. So we choose Flask as the framework, the MVC model could help us saving time of repeting codes and makes it easier to generate data from the database and display it on the website by separting codes into model and view.
